# Dumb-Fish
A Chess bot that I am still working on as a personal project. The entire system is developed in python and has 4 different game modes two of which utilise the chess bot as part of the game mode. The game modes can be selected and played through a graphical user interface that I developed for the system.

# Game types - regular games and training games :

Regular games can either be single player or two player. The two player game is two users playing a game of chess on the same device and the single playuer game mode plays a game of chess against the chess bot. 

The training games consist of the practice game mode which is a single player game except the player can request a move suggestion from the chess bot giving the player a helping hand when making a move and the Chess Compositions game mode which loads a preset board stored as a text file in the Chess_Comp folder that has a preset sequence of moves that the player must complete. The Player gets 3 hints when playing a chess compostion which shows the next move to be completed.

# Gameplay :
- To select a game mode different menu selection screens will appear so the user can select a game mode and adjust any settings for the game such as difficulty.
- When actually playing a game the user can move pieces on the board by either clicking and dragging a piece to an appropriate square or selectn the white textbox and typing the moves in chess notation.
- Most game modes include an undo button and a draw button so the player can call a draw or undo their previous move by clicking the button.
